# RVALocalEats

RVA Local Eats is a restaurant review application in which a user can either enter a review about a resturant based on specific criteria, or utilize a "where should I eat" feature. When users choose to use the latter feature, they are prompted to make choices regarding their desired target price, type of dining, dietary choices, etc. The application then matches the user with an appropriate dining option based on their desires. All user information is stored in a MySQL database.
